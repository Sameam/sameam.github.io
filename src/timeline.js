                  I architect and implement comprehensive AI solutions spanning conversational agents, speech synthesis, and microservices infrastructure. 
                  My work centers on developing LLM-powered conversational agents using LangChain and RAG architecture for contextually-aware responses, while leading Text-to-Speech (TTS) and streaming technology projects that contribute to innovative digital products. 
                  I utilize machine learning algorithms and PyTorch to achieve 30% improvements in both data processing accuracy and system responsiveness through robust microservices architecture. On the technical infrastructure side, 
                  I develop high-performance C++ API interfaces using STL containers and smart pointer management for seamless external system integration, and deploy containerized AI microservices across AWS EKS and Azure AKS environments, achieving 20% faster deployment speeds and 35% improved scalability. 
                  Additionally, I mentor interns on AI service deployment and mobile application integration, enabling the creation of AI-agent chat systems that replicate real-time phone call interactions.`,
